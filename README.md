This is the repository for the new Burgess Family Orchard website.

http://burgessorchards.com/

The current website is a Wordpress template. I am planning on launching a new website for the family for next year.

The site will be built with AngularJs and Bootstrap, with a backend utilizing Express, Node, and PostgreSQL (MassiveJS). The site will be fully responsive, and add several requested features, such as sign-ups, contact lists, and order requests.
